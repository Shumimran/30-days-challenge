Hello, AI world
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the technology that helps computers think and learn like humans. It can recognize patterns, make decisions, and solve problems. AI is used in apps like chatbots, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems. As a beginner, I am excited to learn how AI works and how to build small projects using it.
